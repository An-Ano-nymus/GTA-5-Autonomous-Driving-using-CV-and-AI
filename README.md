# 🚗 GTA 5 Autonomous AI Driver using Computer Vision and Deep Learning

This project showcases an AI-powered **Autonomous Driving Agent** for GTA V built using **OpenCV**, **Deep Learning (CNNs)**, and **TensorFlow 2.0**. The system captures the driver’s in-game view, processes the visual input to detect road lanes and obstacles, and sends simulated keystrokes to control the car — all in real time.

## 🧠 Key Features

- **Real-Time Lane Detection**: Uses OpenCV to identify lanes and process road boundaries.
- **CNN-Based Decision System**: Trained a Convolutional Neural Network to classify road scenarios and predict driving actions.
- **Self-Driving Logic**: AI agent decides when to accelerate, steer, or slow down based on live visual feed.
- **Crash Avoidance**: Detects obstacles to ensure safe navigation.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV, NumPy, TensorFlow 2.0, Keras
- **Tools:** PyAutoGUI / DirectInput for key simulation, Windows Screen Capture
- **Game:** GTA V (PC Version)

## 🧪 Workflow

1. **Data Collection**  
   - Captured screen frames during manual gameplay.
   - Labeled the data with the associated key presses (`W`, `A`, `D`, etc.).

2. **Preprocessing**  
   - Converted frames to grayscale or RGB.
   - Cropped to focus on the road and resized images to reduce training time.

3. **Model Training**  
   - Trained a CNN on the processed dataset with action labels.
   - Evaluated over multiple epochs to avoid overfitting.

4. **Inference and Control**  
   - AI predicts the correct driving action for each frame in real time.
   - Simulated keystrokes sent to GTA V using key control libraries.
